<title>GENERAL NOTES</title>
<para><emphasis role="bold">GENERAL LIMITATIONS</emphasis></para>
<para>This Configuration Deviation List contains additional certificate
limitations for operation of all BOEING Model 757 Aircraft with certain
secondary airframe and engine parts missing and with certain parts
damaged by hail when on the ground as listed herein. The Certificate
Limitations in the Aircraft Flight Manual are applicable except as
amended in this appendix.</para>
<para>The associated limitations must be listed on a placard affixed
in the cockpit in clear view of the pilot-in-command and other appropriate
crew member(s). </para>
<para>Operation with those missing parts requiring a reduction of
VMO/MMO is permitted only when the aircraft has the airspeed limit
speed hand and the Mach airspeed warning system programmed for the
altitude/speed schedule specified for the applicable missing part.</para>
<para>The pilot in command will be notified of each operation with
a missing or damaged part(s) by listing the missing or damaged part(s)
in the flight release.  In addition the item will be entered in the
Deferred Item Log.</para>
<para>The operator will list in the aircraft logbook an appropriate
notation covering the missing or damaged part(s) on each flight.</para>
<para>If an additional part is lost in flight the aircraft may not
depart the airport at which it landed following this event until it
again complies with the limitation of this section. This, of course,
does not preclude the issuance of a ferry permit to allow the aircraft
to be flown to a point where the necessary repairs or replacements
can be made.</para>
<para>No more than one part for any sub-system in this section may
be missing unless specifically designated combinations are indicated
herein. Unless otherwise specified herein, parts from different sub-systems
may be missing. The performance penalties are cumulative unless specifically
designated penalties for combinations of missing parts are indicated.
 Where performance penalties are listed as negligible, no more than
three negligible items may be missing without taking further penalty.
 For each missing item more than three, reduce the takeoff, landing,
and en route climb limits 100 pounds.</para>
<para>Takeoff performance decrements are applicable to takeoff gross
weights which are limited by field length, first segment climb, second
segment climb, final segment climb, or takeoff flight path.</para>
<para>Landing performance decrements are applicable to landing gross
weights which are limited by landing field length, landing climb,
or approach climb. </para>
<para>En route performance decrements are applicable to operations
which are limited by en route, reduced number of engines operative
climb performance. </para>
<para>The numbering and designation of systems in this appendix is
based on ATA Spec. 100.  The parts within each system are identified
by functional description and, when necessary, by part number.</para>
<textgrp>
<title>EN ROUTE FUEL MILEAGE EFFECTS</title>
<para>The drag effects of many 757 CDL items are so small that en
route fuel mileage changes are negligible.  For items with significant
drag effects, a fuel mileage decrement of 0.7% per 1000 lbs. of en
route climb penalty was used to determine the approximate fuel burn
figures shown.</para>
</textgrp>
<textgrp>
<title>WEIGHT REDUCTIONS</title>
<para>The performance penalties are cumulative unless specifically
designated penalties for combination of missing parts are indicated.
 Where performance penalties are listed as negligible, no more than
three negligible items may be missing without taking further penalty.
 For each missing item more than three, reduce takeoff, landing and
en route climb limits 100 pounds.</para>
<textgrp>
<title>PLACARDING</title>
<para>Install "CDL LIMITATIONS" placard on the First Officer's forward
instrument panel between landing gear handle and airspeed indicator,
and enter item in Aircraft Deferred Item Log.</para>
