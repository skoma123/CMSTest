must be documented in the Aircraft Logbook at the prescribed intervals.

<note><para>Bottle charge can be verified two ways: electrically per
step 1) or by weighing the bottle per step 2). If the electrical check
passes, the aircraft may be dispatched. If the electrical check fails,
the failure may be in the pressure switch, and the system may still
be acceptable for dispatch if the bottle charge is verified by weighing.</para>
