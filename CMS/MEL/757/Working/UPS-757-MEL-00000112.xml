<note><para>With an air conditioning pack inoperative or OFF, isolation
valve closed, and anti-ice OFF, a BLEED OFF Light may illuminate during
takeoff power application. Under these conditions, the PRSOV is regulating
air pressure to a point where the valve angle is small enough to activate
the light switch. As engine power, and thus air pressure, is reduced
the valve angle opens slightly and the BLEED OFF Light extinguishes.</para>
