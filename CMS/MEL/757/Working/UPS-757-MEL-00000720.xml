<note><para>The repetitive inspection required when this item is inoperative
must be documented in the Aircraft Logbook at the prescribed intervals.

<para>Before each departure, perform a single hydraulic flight controls
check with each of the three hydraulic systems as follows:</para>

<numlitem><para>Observe Center Electric Pump PRESS light(s) extinguished.</para>
<note><para>If the aircraft is using only the APU or ground power,
there is no power to the number 2 pump therefore the number 1 center
electric pump will come on and only the PRESS light for the number
1 pump will extinguish. </para></note>

<numlitem><para>Rudder check: Displace rudder in both directions while
observing rudder deflection on EICAS status display. Verify movement
in proper direction, and that deflection rate is normal (rate is non-normal
if control surface deflection lags significantly behind pilot input).</para>
<note><para>Hold the nose wheel steering tiller stationary during
rudder check to prevent nose wheel movement. </para></note>
</numlitem>
<numlitem><para>Elevator check: Set the stabilizer to 7 units. Displace
control column forward and aft while observing elevator deflection
on EICAS status display. Control column sweep should be accomplished
at a rate of 8-12 seconds for a full column sweep (from neutral to
full nose up to full nose down to neutral). Verify movement in proper
direction, and that deflection rate is normal (rate is non-normal
if control surface deflection lags significantly behind pilot input).
Also verify that both elevators track the column input and that there
is no significant disagreement between the two surfaces. Ensure that
each surface returns to neutral position when the column is returned
to neutral.</para>
<note><para>The SPOILERS light and message may illuminate if the control
wheel is displaced with only the center system hydraulics available.
The light will extinguish after the left and right hydraulic systems
are powered.</para></note>
