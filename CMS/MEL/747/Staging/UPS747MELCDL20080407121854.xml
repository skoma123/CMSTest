<note><para>Each of the two hydro-mechanical fuel scavenge systems
include two jet pumps located in the CWT and two float valves; One
valve located in the CWT and one valve located in the associated inboard
main tank. For a system with both jet pumps inoperative or either
float valve inoperative closed, that system will not transfer fuel
from the center wing tank, making the system inoperative. With either
float valve inoperative open, it may be necessary to deactivate the
system to prevent the unwanted fuel transfer from center wing tank
to the associated inboard main tank.</para></note>
