<para>For the Fwd Main Deck zone, a closed (0%) valve position will
result in a zone temperature that eventually stabilizes at approximately
40&deg;F (4&deg;C). A valve secured 40% open will result in a zone
temperature that eventually stabilizes at approximately 70&deg;F (21&deg;C).
This assumes cargo carried in the Fwd Main Deck is not heat generating.
For desired intermediate temperatures between 40&deg;F and 70&deg;F,
secure the valve at a position between 0% and 40%. For the Aft Main
Deck zone, there are two trim air mod valves. Both valves secured
closed with result in a zone temperature that eventually stabilizes
at approximately 40&deg;F (4&deg;C). With one valve secured closed
and the other valve secured 40% open, Aft Main Deck zone temperature
will eventually stabilize at approximately 70&deg;F (21&deg;C). This
assumes cargo carried in the Aft Main Deck is not heat generating.
For desired intermediate temperatures between 40&deg;F and 70&deg;F,
secure the valve at a position between 0% and 40%. F/D, U/D, and C/R
zone(s) trim air mod valve position selection must take into consideration
the fact that pack outlet air temperature is controlled to satisfy
the zone needing the coldest air supply temperature. If a relatively
cold zone temperature is selected for main deck or a lower lobe zone,
the F/D, U/D, and C/R zone(s) trim air mod valve position should be
positioned more open in their recommended range. (The opposite is
true if a relatively warm zone temperature is selected for a main
or lower lobe zone.)</para>
